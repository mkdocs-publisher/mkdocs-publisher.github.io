The main reason for that is how MkDocs internals work. For example, when navigation is built and when final HTML files are generated. Other example could be a document status implementation that influences navigation building, file list creation and <code>sitemap.xml</code> creation. This process should be considered as one functionality and splitting it over 2 separate plugins is possible, but it will not only increase code complexity, but also will increase significantly complexity of configuration since many settings used for automatic navigation building are the same for defining file meta-data. So, if we split functionality into 2 separate plugins, the final user (You) will have to maintain consistency in <code>mkdocs.yml</code> file. With a single plugin approach, we can reduce this problem to just maintaining a single point of configuration and settings validation.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>However, this plugin is not needed for other plugins to work correctly, it's highly recommended to use it.</p>"},{"location":"setup/general/pub-meta/#meta-data","title":"Meta-data","text":"<p>Markdown documents can contain additional metadata that is not rendered by MkDocs.

Probably the easiest way of file ordering is to provide some prefix with the digits (take a look at this documentation repository for better understanding). The main problem with this approach would be strange names in file URLs and documentation titles on the web page. To solve that problems, the meta plugin uses two meta-data values that are common for document files and directories:</p>  title slug <p><code>title</code> is responsible for document name that is visible in the generated web page.</p> <pre><code>---\ntitle: Document title\n---\n</code></pre> <p><code>slug</code> is responsible for document URL.

Obsidian introduces some additional syntax options like callouts (equivalent to Markdown admonitions) and WikiLinks for creating internal links.

To make it \"understandable\" for MkDocs, it has to be \"translated\" into regular Markdown syntax.</p> <p>Translation is non-destructive</p> <p>All markdown translations (or rather I should say conversions) are non-destructive to your Obsidian vault and occurs \"on the fly\" while static files are produced. It means that you can use this plugin side-by-side with Obsidian and use, for example, git repository as your vault backup. You don't have to copy or specially prepare your files before using this tool.</p> <p>For that reason, a new plugin was created, that supports not only the mentioned Obsidian elements, but also some additional ones like:</p> <ul> <li>backlinks,</li> <li>callouts,</li> <li>wikilinks,</li> <li>vega charts (using Vega Visualization Plugin for Obsidian) - advanced solution for creating charts.</li> </ul> <p>If you need support for additional plugins, please make an issue with a future description.</p> <p>For more details about this release, read more below or jump directly to pub-obsidianplugin documentation.</p> <p>I need to start to implement unit tests because this project becomes too big to test it manually and deliver production grade quality. Probably after introducing unit tests, I will end the beta period of this project and consider it as a production ready. It doesn't mean that the project will be complete or free from errors, but at least new releases should not break pages built with this project.</p> <p>Also from now on all new releases will be smaller. I will try to focus on smaller improvements and fixes, so you should fell like this project is more alive.</p> <p>Last thing is a new project logo:</p> <p></p> <p>Known Issues</p> <p>List of known issues:</p> <ul> <li> <p>internal links in blog teasers are not working,</p> </li> <li> <p>using icons in page title, will cause problems with title display in the browser window.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v100/#changelog","title":"Changelog","text":"","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v100/#general","title":"General","text":"<ul> <li>\u274e internal class for HTML modifications</li> <li>\u267b\ufe0f project license to MIT</li> <li>\u267b\ufe0f project <code>README.md</code> cleanup</li> <li>\u267b\ufe0f internal method for importing other plugin config (needed for cross functionalities)</li> </ul>","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v100/#auto-nav-plugin-removed","title":"Auto-nav (plugin removed)","text":"<p>The whole functionality of this plugin has been moved to a new Meta plugin.</p>","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v100/#blog","title":"Blog","text":"<ul> <li>\u274e exclude from search blog posts teaser/index, category, tag or archive pages</li> <li>\u274e exclude comments in blog posts teaser/index, category, tag or archive pages</li> <li>\u2705 internal links for blog posts teaser/index, category, tag or archive pages</li> <li>\ud83d\udeab removed <code>edit_url</code> for blog teaser/index, category, tag or archive pages</li> <li>\u267b\ufe0f automatic detection of the blog as starting page (config value for this setting was removed)</li> <li>\u274e post publication state (provided by Meta plugin)</li> </ul>","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v100/#social","title":"Social","text":"<ul> <li>\u267b\ufe0f code refactor of HTML modification elements and logging added</li> </ul>","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v100/#meta-new-plugin","title":"Meta (new plugin)","text":"<p>This plugin is a Swiss army knife that helps a lot with various tasks related to publication, SEO, etc. Take a look at the below changelog to see what is offered by this plugin.</p> <ul> <li>\u274e build navigation based on file names order</li> <li>\u274e set multiple document parameters by using its metadata:<ul> <li><code>title</code> - document title</li> <li><code>slug</code>- URL of the document</li> <li><code>status</code> - document publication status (published, hidden, draft)</li> <li><code>date</code> - document creation date</li> <li><code>update</code> - document last update date (used for sitemap and SEO optimizations)</li> </ul> </li> <li>\u274e directory metadata and additional settings can be set in a frontmatter of <code>*.md</code> file (default to <code>README.md</code>):         - possibility to define <code>slug</code>(this affects only the directory where <code>README.md</code> is placed)<ul> <li>possibility to define <code>skip_dir</code>(this affects only the directory and all subdirectories where the file is located)</li> <li>possibility to define <code>hidden_dir</code>(this affects only the directory and all subdirectories where the file is located)</li> </ul> </li> <li>\u274e while serve page locally, all hidden and draft pages becomes published (this setting, helps with document preview while writing)</li> </ul>","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v100/#obsidian-new-plugin","title":"Obsidian (new plugin)","text":"<p>This plugin is a set of functionalities and should be split into various smaller plugins, but due to some cross functionalities, it has been integrated into the bigger one.

I have promised to make smaller releases, but my brain is refusing me to work on a small scale. It's really hard to achieve that, especially when I started to have some feedback from you, users of this tool. Because of that feedback and some problems you encountered, I decided to focus in this release on 2 main topics: some bug fixing and introducing a new plugin called pub-debugger. This plugin allows for an insight into all messages produced by plugins while building (or serving) a web page. Also, it's able to produce a ZIP file, with some basic information that could help me, whenever you will need to report an issue.</p> <p>Privacy disclaimer</p> <p><code>pub-debugger</code> plugin do not send any files over the internet, but if you want to use a Zip file as an attachment for an issue submission or share it with anybody, please make a review of the content of this archive file.</p> <p>Please remember</p> <p>It's your data and your responsibility what you are publishing over the internet. This plugin is only giving you the tool that should help, and you cannot blame me (the author of this plugin) for any potential data leaks.</p> <p>There is also one very crucial topic related to this project name. When I shared information about Publisher for MkDocs over an official Obsidian.md community forum the developer of an Obsidian GitHub Publisher plugin provided me information that we have some conflict related to our plugins name. We were also spoken privately over Discord and came to some agreement related to our work. More information can be found in this thread, but in short:</p> <ul> <li>My set of MkDocs plugins will be called Publisher for MkDocs since my work is related to MkDocs with additional support for Obsidian as an IDE/text editor,</li> <li>Mara-Li Obsidian plugin will be called GitHub Publisher since her work is related to Obsidian with the possibility to use MkDocs as a beck-end for publication.</li> </ul> <p>In the feature, some elements of this project could be part of Mara-Li work, but it's her decision. I will continue working on this project and help her with some potential issues solving.</p> <p>I have also spent some time on unification of look the setup documentation. Previously, documentation was created a similar way as Material for MkDocs is doing it, but I decided to drop this approach and simplify it a little bit. Most of the work was around configuration options, that was too verbose. Currently, all configuration options related to given functionality are gathered in a single code block with their default values, so it's easier to copy it to yours <code>mkdocs.yaml</code> file. As a result, all descriptions related to those options are placed below this code block, so it's easy to find the information about it. I hope it's now easier to navigate and understand all the configuration options.</p> <p>A lot of you have been asking me about comparison to other tools and I have answered to them in this Reddit thread. I have a plan to gather all this information and create a separate document about this (and also to some credits to projects I get inspiration from), but simply didn't have time for that so far.</p> <p>There were also some requests related to the publication process. I'm aware that this is the biggest lacking right now of this project that is supposed to be related to publishing, and I will definitely solve this soon. There is an upcoming update related to that as:</p> <ul> <li>GitHub template repository,</li> <li>Docker image,</li> <li>GitHub Action,</li> <li>documentation.</li> </ul> <p>I don't promise that all of the above will be ready in the next release, but some of them will be for sure.</p>","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v110/#changelog","title":"Changelog","text":"","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v110/#general","title":"General","text":"<ul> <li>\u267b\ufe0f rename of directory with documentation files</li> <li>\u267b\ufe0f Python libraries update</li> <li>\u267b\ufe0f project naming unification</li> <li>\u267b\ufe0f pre-commit JSON check and obsidian file exclusion</li> <li>\u267b\ufe0f some links updates in documentation</li> <li>\u267b\ufe0f code type hinting updates</li> <li>\u267b\ufe0f logger names unification - it's related to pub-debugger plugin</li> <li>\u267b\ufe0f code refactor and cleanup</li> <li>\ud83d\udeab drop <code>python-frontmatter</code> from Python libraries</li> </ul>","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v110/#blog","title":"Blog","text":"<ul> <li>\u2705 minor fix for internal linking (still not full solution)</li> <li>\u267b\ufe0f fix for deprecated warning regarding <code>importlib.resources</code></li> </ul>","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v110/#minifier","title":"Minifier","text":"<ul> <li>\u267b\ufe0f small code reformat related to shared library changes</li> <li>\u267b\ufe0f files are not minified when using <code>mkdocs serve</code> (this is default behavior, but it can be changed)</li> </ul>","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v110/#meta","title":"Meta","text":"<ul> <li>\u274e possibility to declare whole directory as hidden</li> <li>\u274e more logging messages</li> <li>\u274e better support for <code>pub-obsidian</code> plugin (template and obsidian directory are now always drafts)</li> <li>\u2705 fix for error with reading <code>README.md</code> when no empty line at the end of file</li> <li>\u2705 fix for adding again the same directory to draft directories when using <code>mkdocs serve</code></li> </ul>","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v110/#obsidian","title":"Obsidian","text":"<ul> <li>\u2705 minor fix for internal linking (still not full fix)</li> <li>\u2705 fix for preserving new line in callouts</li> </ul>","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v110/#debugger-new-plugin","title":"Debugger (new plugin)","text":"<ul> <li>\u274e console log reformatting with configuration</li> <li>\u274e added logging into <code>*.log</code> file with configuration</li> <li>\u274e added old log file replacement</li> <li>\u274e ZIP file creation with log output and some additional files</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>\u274e - added \u2705 - fixed \u267b\ufe0f\ufe0f - changed \ud83d\udeab - removed</p>","tags":["v1.x"]},{"location":"blog/v111/","title":"v1.1.1 - 2023.10.10","text":"<p>This release is probably one of the most important ones for this project, but was also a bit problematic. You can ask why?</p> <p>The biggest problem that I had, was about numbering this release. Because I wanted to bump all main dependencies (mainly Material for MkDocs) i found that one of the metadata key names was colliding with Material for MkDocs and leading to unexpected behavior. I had to change it and for that reason, I was wondering how to handle this event. From one point of view, this is somehow braking change and I should create a v2.0.0, but didn't feel like this is release is big enough. It doesn't include any new functionality and is focused on bug fixes and internal improvements.</p> <p>Publication status key rename</p> <p>Pub-metadocument or directory status metadata key has been renamed from <code>status</code> to <code>publish</code>.
